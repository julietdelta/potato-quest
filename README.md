Potato Quest - the game of life

Set up as an Eclipse project on Java 1.8. It will use LWJGL.

Standards
=========

Use camelCasing for variables!

Be liberal with spaces and conservative with new lines.

Use new lines to separate blocks of code that do different things. Don't be arbitrary. Follow this if statement as an example of spacing.

              //note the space after "if", on either side of the operator, and after the closing parenthesis.
              if (butts == hot) { 
                            //Also note that the first bracket DOES NOT go on a new line
              } else
                  System.out.println("You don't have to use brackets if they aren't necessary");
